# Welcome to products-provider! ðŸ§²

> Gradle-based project. This project's goal is to extract data from an excel sheet (precos-ribeirao-preto.xlsx) containing the most varied products and their respective barcodes and send them to Kafka through a DTO so they can be consumed by the supermarket-rpa.

## Use docker to start kafka broker

In your terminal, input the following command:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

After application has started, make an POST request to the following endpoint:
```sh
localhost:8080/products?zipCode={zipCode_here}
```

The endpoint receives a query param zipCode where you can input any valid zip code in it.

## Server is ready to run!
